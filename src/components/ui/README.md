# UI Components

**Accessibility Reminder:**
All custom UI components should be checked for accessibility (a11y). Use [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or browser devtools to audit for color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader compatibility. Radix UI primitives help, but custom logic/layouts need manual review.

Add documentation for each component here as needed.
